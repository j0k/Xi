The Language XiL
----------------

The language to be supported by the Xi project is called XiL or &Xi;L.

This language is an abstract language, having no fixed concrete presentation, so that it can be presented as many different languages in different contexts (this is multilingual support by _semantic embedding_).

The language is very simple, it is an _illative_ lambda calculus, obtained by adding a single combinator, Xi, which approximates equality, to the pure lambda-calculus.
It is type-free, but its concrete presentations (apart from the most basic) are likely to be typed.
