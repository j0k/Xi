    I did consider making this into a class, but I couldn't figure
    out what the benefit would be, so for the time being its just
    a module defining various functions for making taking apart and
    otherwise processing terms.

    The terms are represented by triples.
    The first element is a number which tells you whether the term
    a variable, an abstraction or an application.

    In a variable the second element of the tuple is its name and the
    third is zero

    In an abstraction the second element is the name of the variable
    being bound and the third is the body of the abstraction (a term).

    In an application the second and third elements of the tuple are
    the function and the argument (both terms).

        the immediate constituents."""
