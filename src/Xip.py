1. It will support the abstract logic &XiL;, which has no definite concrete syntax.  Other languages and logics as concrete presentations of &Xi;L expressions.

2. The logic will be a Hilbert style deductive system.

3. The implementqtion paradigm will be derived from the LCF paradigm.

4. The implementation language will be python, but an executable subset of &Xi; will be used for tactical programming.

5. Theorem proving will be *distributed*.
