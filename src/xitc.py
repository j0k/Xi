    a variable, an abstraction or an application.

    In a variable the second element of the tuple is its name and the
    third is zero

    In an abstraction the second element is the name of the variable
    being bound and the third is the body of the abstraction (a term).

    In an application the second and third elements of the tuple are
    the function and the argument (both terms).""
