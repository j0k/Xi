Introduction to The Xi Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Xi project is a trial in the application of "Deep Learning" to interactive proof.

To give maximum scope for adaptation of interative proof to the exploitation of deep learning the project uses a completely new ITP system, and in many aspects of the system I am trying out new ideas, not necessarily motivated by the use of deep learning.
