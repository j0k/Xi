The Logic XiL
_____________

The deductive system is as yet not settled, but will likely be a Hilbert style forward inference system in which theorems are just terms of the language (though with elaborate presentations) and inference by contextual rewriting of subterms.

The following details are very tentative.

The inference rules are:

    alpha-conversion

    beta-conversion

    substitution into subterms using equations in the context of the term

Strength is given by two axioms, the consistency of which is controversial:

    choice, in the form a well-ordering assertion
        (under which a well-ordering of the universe serves as a set of ordinals)

    strong infinity, asserting at least that the universe is inaccessible
